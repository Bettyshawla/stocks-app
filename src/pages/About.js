      <h1>About Stocks</h1>
      <p>
        A stock, also known as equity, is a security that represents the
        ownership of a fraction of the issuing corporation. Units of stock are
        called "shares" which entitles the owner to a proportion of the
        corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own.
        Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges and are the
        foundation of many individual investors' portfolios. Stock trades have
        to conform to government regulations meant to protect investors from
        fraudulent practices.

        Stockholders do not own a corporation but corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons. Corporations file taxes. can borrow, can own property, and can be sued. The idea that a corporation is a “person” means that the corporation owns its assets. A corporate office full of chairs and tables belongs to the corporation, and not to the shareholders.

<br/>

Corporate property is legally separated from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability of both the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets sold but a shareholder's assets are not at risk. The court cannot force you to sell your shares, although the value of your shares may have fallen. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, they cannot sell the company’s assets to pay their creditors.
